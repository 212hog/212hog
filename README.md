# Tinnitus Neuromodulation with Adaptive AI

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about exploring the intersection of neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and audiology, specifically focusing on developing innovative treatments for tinnitus.

## About Me

I'm currently researching the application of adaptive AI techniques to optimize neuromodulation therapies for tinnitus. My goal is to leverage machine learning to personalize treatment protocols and improve patient outcomes.

My interests include:

* **Tinnitus Heterogeneity:** Understanding the diverse presentations and underlying mechanisms of tinnitus.
* **Neuromodulation:** Investigating the efficacy of techniques like transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS) in tinnitus management.
* **Adaptive AI:** Developing algorithms that can dynamically adjust neuromodulation parameters based on real-time patient feedback.
* **Neuroimaging Analysis:** Utilizing fMRI, EEG, and other neuroimaging modalities to study brain activity and treatment response.
* **Data-Driven Research:** Building and analyzing large datasets to train and validate AI models.

## Projects

This section will be updated with relevant projects as they develop. Expect to see:

* Algorithms for real-time neuromodulation parameter optimization.
* Machine learning models for predicting tinnitus treatment outcomes.
* Tools for analyzing neuroimaging data related to tinnitus.
* Data visualization of tinnitus patient data.

## Current Focus

* Exploring open-source neuroimaging datasets (e.g., OpenNeuro, DANDI) for tinnitus research.
* Developing machine learning pipelines for analyzing EEG and fMRI data.
* Investigating reinforcement learning techniques for adaptive neuromodulation.
* Learning best practices for data privacy, and ethical AI development.

## Get in Touch

I'm always open to collaboration and discussion. Feel free to reach out to me if you're interested in:

* Collaborating on research projects.
* Sharing resources and datasets.
* Discussing the latest advancements in tinnitus research and AI.


## Future Directions

* Clinical validation of AI-driven neuromodulation protocols.
* Integration of wearable sensor data for real-time patient monitoring.
* Development of user-friendly tools for clinicians to implement AI-based tinnitus treatments.
